I didn't expect it would turn out to be so delicious. Take a look a the photos below.</p>

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/GZBcZKR.jpg'  alt="" />

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li><code>0.3kg</code> beef strips</li>
<li><code>2</code> mid-sized onions</li>
<li><code>1</code> <code>.33cl</code> bottle of Murphy's Irish Red</li>
<li><code>1</code> tomato</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spices">Spices</h3>

<ul>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>basil</li>
<li>red paprika (it would be even better if it was smoked paprika)</li>
<li>a couple of chili peppers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

<p>I put the two sliced onions on a preheated pan with olive oil and added salt. When they turned yellow, I put the meat on top and closed the pan. Shortly there after I also put one sliced tomato on top of everything and let everything boil a little.</p>

<p>Once I was sure the meat was cooked I put in all of the above mentioned spices. I don't remember the exact ratio as I used my taste to guide me.</p>

<p>Just before the whole sauce evaporated I poured in around <code>0.15cl</code> of Irish Red and let it cook a few minutes more.</p>

<p>And that's it!</p>]]></description><link>http://steiner.website/blog/beef-stew-recipe/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1a03c30a-a54b-4e2c-8bfa-d988710b5efb</guid><category><![CDATA[food]]></category><category><![CDATA[recipe]]></category><category><![CDATA[stew]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jerko Steiner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2014 07:51:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amsterdam on Saturday]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I went for a walk with my camera today.

<p>From <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munttoren' >Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Munttoren ("Coin Tower") or Munt is a tower in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It stands on the busy Muntplein square, where the Amstel river and the Singel canal meet, near the flower market and the eastern end of the Kalverstraat shopping street.</p>
  
  <p>The tower was originally part of the Regulierspoort, one of the main gates in Amsterdam's medieval city wall. The gate, built in the years 1480, consisted of two towers and a guard house.</p>

As the web site says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ImageMagick® is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the basic comand I use to resize a single image:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">convert source.png -resize x720 output.png  
</code></pre>

<p>It takes the <code>source.png</code>, resizes it's height to <code>720px</code>, keeps the proportions, and saves it as <code>output.png</code>. You could also specify the desired width instead of height with <code>1280x</code>, or specific dimensions with <code>1280x720</code>.</p>

<p>If I wanted to do the same for all images in the current directory, I would make use of the <a href='http://linux.die.net/man/1/find' >find</a> command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">mkdir resized  
find *.png -exec convert {} -resize x720 resized/{} \;  
</code></pre>

<p>This will convert all <code>png</code> files in the current directory and output them to the <code>resized/</code> subdirectory. The <code>\;</code> part is a delimiter which tells <code>find</code> where is the end of the command to execute.</p>

<p>To add the watermark to the bottom-right corner of an image you can use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">composite -gravity southeast -geometry +10+10 watermark.png source.png output.png  
</code></pre>

<p>To resize the image and automatically add the watermark:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">convert source.png -resize x720 miff:- | composite -gravity southeast -geometry +10+10 watermark.png miff:- output.png  
</code></pre>

<p>Here we made use of the <code>miff</code>, ImageMagick's intermediary file format which enables image pipelining between multiple commands.</p>

<p>It's a bit more complicated to do pipes with the find command, so I created a <code>bash</code> script which does that:</p>

<script src='https://gist.github.com/jeremija/1a24c3aa1d51cec5ede7.js' ></script>

<p>The basic syntax is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">resize.sh &lt;source image&gt; &lt;dimensions&gt; &lt;destination folder&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>So to automatically scale the height of all images in current folder to <code>720px</code>, keep their proportions, and add watermarks we can use:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash line-numbers">mkdir watermarked/  
find *.png -exec /path/to/resize.sh {} x720 watermarked/ \;  
</code></pre>]]></description><link>http://steiner.website/blog/how-to-batch-resize-images-and-add-watermarks/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4467f310-b50f-4dd6-884b-4801a7e06352</guid><category><![CDATA[linux]]></category><category><![CDATA[imagemagick]]></category><category><![CDATA[image processing]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jerko Steiner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 19:33:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA["Do you know of any XYZ developers?"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>One of the first things I noticed when I moved to Amsterdam was that there is a lot of businesses going on. A lot more than in my home country.</p>

<p>Just a week before I moved here, I was offered an interview for a senior position at Booking.com. When I said was already coming there next week, but for another job, I was asked if I can recommend anybody else. They seemed desperate to find somebody.</p>

<p>The first thing on my To Do list was to find a gym nearby where I could weightlift after work. During the first few visits I met a guy who worked for another start-up. He said they are constantly looking for developers.</p>

<p>A few days ago I met a tourist from Paris who owns a French startup. As soon as he realized I do software, he said they are looking for good JavaScript developers and also asked me for a recommendation.</p>

<p>All of this is really new to me because these kinds of things never happened to me in Zagreb. Sure, every now and then I would hear about an open position, but I didn't get the impression there was a constant demand for Software Engineers.</p>

<p>I'm really curious if all of this has just been a series of coincidences, or there really are a lot more open positions here. And if there are, I wonder what would be the right steps to take to make a similar atmosphere back home?</p>]]></description><link>http://steiner.website/blog/know-of-any-good-developers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">673b5926-03f1-4d61-a6b9-4387cd69c47e</guid><category><![CDATA[amsterdam]]></category><category><![CDATA[jobs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jerko Steiner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 17:51:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[About me]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a 26 year old Software Developer from Zagreb recently moved to Amsterdam to work for a start-up company which is about to shake up the retail industry.</p>

<p>I recently discovered this nice blog platform called <a href='http://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a> which I really like as it is lightweight and enables me to write posts in Markdown notation.</p>
